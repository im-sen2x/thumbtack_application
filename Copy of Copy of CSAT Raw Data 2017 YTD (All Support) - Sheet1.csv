i was politely  advised that it would be up to me to find a way to repair my home. i was advised that i had to reach out to the contractor or the local courts to get a settlement. in essence, thumbtack did nothing to help me with this contractor issue. i have an incomplete job, a home with doors that don't function and a service intermediary with no empathy or accountability. it's now been over a month and my job is still not complete. but thumbtack assures me that no one else will have the option to work with this contractor, through their service, until my dispute is resolved. 1/10 would not endorse their support service.",My issue is not resolved

I have to request a photo, or ask the customer to give me a call, so I can ask them about there project, before I can even submit a quote, and 80% of the time, I get no response what so ever, so I waste credits all the time. Please check, you will see on multiple occasions, I try to contact the customer multiple times, and get no response. If I don't waste my credits, to ask for photos, or for a call back, then I wouldn't even be able to quote on any jobs. You need to make the customer add a photo, in the beginning of there request, if they cant add a photo, then they have to leave a contact number, for follow up questions.  This will also help weed out the ones that are not serious about needing to hire someone, also. 
In upholstery, there are too many styles and sizes of pieces, to give a quote without seeing, or not having all the info needed. I hope you can understand my frustration.
 I have been giving thumbtack a real chance to work for me, but with the rising price of credits, and raising the amount of credits to quote, and the lack of info to do quote, and after wasting hundreds of hundreds of credits, just to try and give a quote, you are not making it easy. I have 5 star reviews, on all reviews. You consider me a top pro, but I really don't feel like I am being treated like a top pro.

I feel you don't stand behind Professionals who have stuck it out with you (even with all the fake requests we spent hundreds to bid on) since 2012, and we most likely will not be using your site any longer in spite of the fact we do not valued nor important!

It is sad knowing how much we sacrificed and the amount of customers we had to give a ton of free work to in order to appease them.. all because they held the fact that they could write a negative review at any time over our heads.

The fact that thumbnails are not showing up is the major issue.  At first, it was a two or three not showing up--and I'd have to let my potential clients know to click on the white space, between other samples to see them.  Now, ALL of them are not showing up!!!!!  I had asked Thumbtack to take care of this problem almost three months ago.  Why should I continue to put a boat load of money into Thumbtack (and you keeping raising your prices, outrageously!!!) if I'm not even sure that the customers are seeing the samples I send them--and you just continue to ignore this problem?  Here is Thumbtack's response to my concern, 2 1/2 months ago:

""We are also aware that you are the experts when it comes to using our site and would know better what features are very much helpful and beneficial to you and your business. I want to make sure your voice is heard, so I shared this correspondence along with all your feedback to our Product Team. While we consider all feedback, we may not be able to carry out your request exactly as it was given or in the desired time frame, but we definitely will use it as we look for more ways to improve.""

This is a MAJOR problem!!!!  And I am not getting as many bookings now, since you've revamped the site and ruined the thumbnails of what we send to clients.  And I think it's because they don't see the thumbnails, and are not going to bother clicking around on white space to see them.  The thumbnails are important, because clients have to see that we've actually sent them something to look at!  If they don't see these thumbnails, they will not know to look for the samples we've sent--hence, it ruins our prostpects of getting hired.  I really shouldn't have to spell that out to you guys. 

I sent Thumbnail another letter about this issue, this morning, and have not gotten a response back, yet.  If you guys don't get this issue taken care of, I'm done with you!!!!!!!!!  And I'm sure I'm not the only one who feels this way.  Other people may not bother writing you.  They'll just quit putting their money where it's not working for them anymore, and go to other websites where it will benefit them more, which is what I'm about to do

I then went back to  Thumbtack chat and spoke with a Claire.  She was very ""less than helpful"" and even when I asked for a manager she said that even so, the decision about removing the review would remain the same.  I offered to send all email correspondence with this customer to an address for review by support and she never obliged my request.  This review is WRONG and unwarranted.  This is very disappointing to me as a long-time Thumbtack professional who has spent many thousands of dollars over the years with the company.  I don't feel like my interests as a professional were at all taken into consideration despite that I offered full disclosure of all communication that we have had in our own business emails with this customer.

Third, our review was abruptly removed for containing ""personal"" information when there is none.  In all, Thumbtack failed to take actions at any level to validate that the Pro suggested to us (i.e Tile Maryland) is NOT licensed to do home improvemment work in the State of Maryland. If they had, they would have realized the consequences.",My issue is not resolved

This better be going to someone that will take this review seriously. I've dealt with Joseph first on this issue & now Elizabeth. Nothing was resolved here. I have been blocked from the Thumbtack Facebook page is because it was indicated that I had been posting excessively and not engaging with support when they responded and tried to help. That would be considered spamming the page and a violation of Thumbtack community guidelines. First off I NEVER received ANY kind of warning from the social media moderator for Thumbtack or Facebook for that matter which I would think I should have. I then asked Joseph & then Elizabeth to provide me proof of this so called spamming. I even asked to speak to a member of the social media team. Joseph told me since I was already blocked, any comments I posted have been removed as well. So I'm being judged guilty without being shown any evidence of spamming. That's called SLANDER people! As far me not engaging with support when they responded & tried to help that is a load of crap. When support engaged me I responded back to them. I sent a Facebook message to support about 3 weeks ago before I was blocked. I never heard back from anyone. So tell me again who's not engaging?  Look I'm 55 years old. Why in the hell would I be spamming & not engaging? I don't have time to play games like this. I'm a long time Thumbtack customer & have spent close to $2000 of my hard earned money over the years on credits. If I have a complaint about the product & I see another customer posting on Facebook his or her complaint you can bet your ass I'm going to post back in kind & bring up my similar experience or experiences. If you all at Thumbtack are that sensitive about users, service pros, etc. posting negative stuff about some aspects of your product that's not working on needs to be fixed  then perhaps you should take down your Facebook page then. My goodness! This is all a bunch of childish bullshit! I would appreciate a phone call at 623-734-4010 to discuss this ridiculousness!",My issue is not resolved

We decided to use a company like Angie list. We decided to use Thumtack. Your advertisments were very convincing you were a safe company to use. Sounded like you took extra care to make sure the customer protection was #1. Well I hired a contactor through your web d ite. Only to be taken for $30,000.00. My husband did his own ba c k ground check after we found out you do nothing for the customer as far as protecting rhe goes. Found out the contactor we hired through Thumbtack , has a 3 page rap sheet. He did this to another family for $7000.00. They filed a suite on him. He was to appear in c I urt and skipped town. 
One of hi workers turned him in. He was arested and will be rxpiedidet  back to where ever they file suite on him. While we are out $30,000.00.

Just got our Competitive report back to find the average response time to a quote request was 10 hrs. It would be comical if it wasn't our money being squandered but it is.

When I called the said company, the representative conveyed that my questions were good but she was unable to answer them and the only way for me to have those answered was to bid on a job. The job needs were conflicting. For example, one job indicated it needed Plated Service and Buffet Self-Serve Service. These are not one and the same. The only way for me to find out what the client needed is to apply? That makes no sense. If the client needs plated service for 90 opposed to Buffet Service, that certainly makes a difference in terms of price and service.

Obviously, Thumbtack did no background history on the references claimed by this woman (being a well known photographer from Los Angeles, worked for Vogue, Vanity Fair, Esquire... ) After I had a photo shoot with her I found out that she was not even licensed by the state of Florida and none of her references checked out. I spent $450 for 15 ""retouched"" photos and additionally, $420 and $690 for extra photos (being charged $30 and $35 a piece per photo.) When I received the photos (through a We Transfer App) some photos were blurry and poor quality- but then I suddenly found an add she was running on Groupon scamming people to ""try out a risk free Boudoir photo shoot"" with her for $20- the same shoot I paid $450. So I contacted her about it and that's when she explained that I actually got a better deal than the people buying her Groupon because they have to pay $20, and if they want photos that they would have to buy the same image package I did at $450 and it would only include 10 photos and I should be happy because I received 15 photos in my package... somehow she thought that was going to make me feel like she wasn't scamming people? I started looking into her ""references"" and big surprise, she lied about ever being a photographer for Vogue, Esquire, etc. I then found out that she wasn't even licensed by the state of Florida to be advertising and operating a business. I spent all this money on photos and was lied to and she lied about deleting my photos which I then found out that she works with a company known for teaching photographers to sell and photoshop clients photos for magazines and make money off the photos and I would never even know- I have been asking for a refund from her and possession of all my photos in which she has in her possession (some that are semi nude.)

It is impossible to deal with Jim at Helping Hand Moving Services, his responses and comments are so unprofessional and so off the wall its ridiculous.

I am getting SICK of this,  I KNOW AND AM AWARE OF THE REFUND POLICY that NEEDS READDRESSING. 


The bottom line is this folks who are SEEKING FURTHER INFORMATION or CONDUCTING INITIAL RESEARCH NEVER EVER CALL WITH THEIR REQUESTS OR REQUIREMENTS  and as such are NOT VIABLE AS LEADS. The ONLY WAY SUCH FOLKS are VIABLE is if they indicate READY TO HIRE RIGHT PROFESSIONAL and more often than not even then they DO NOT RESPOND.


YOU CLAIM to be EMPOWERING me as a PROFESSIONAL which I feel you are NOT, by staying in the MIDDLE between me and my potential client you create a buffer through which you can ABSORB MY CREDITS without my actually EVER KNOWING WHAT REALLY HAPPENED beyond the viewing of a QUOTE.  Where this model is serioiusly flawed is that I HAVEN'T ANY WAY to seek out FURTHER INFORMATION OR HELP WITH THE POTENTIAL CLIENT'S RESEARCH MYSELF.  LEADS MUST BE TWO WAY NOT ONE and this is a serious problem I have w/THUMBTACK that is not changing.  YOU CAN & MUST REQUIRE ALL POTENTIAL CLIENTS TO PROVIDE AN E-MAIL & PHONE NUMBER PERIOD. THERE ARE NO IFS, ANDS, OR BUTS about this it HAS TO BE DONE.  The way you do things now really leaves a sour taste in my mouth and I've never said this but you've the POWER to create, look, and change/close LEADS meaning that I d/k weather or not a particular LEAD is put up just to ABSORB my CREDITS (I am not making any acusations, but it is fairly EVIDENT that this is POSSIBLE).  It wouldn't be POSSIBLE and I couldn't possibly think that way if PHONE & E-MAIL info were provisioned from each and every POTENTIAL CLIENT (REQUIRED).  There really isn't any viable argument here, you are NOT EMPOWERING ME AS A PROFESSIONAL by staying in the MIDDLE OF THINGS.  ITS UP TO ME TO ANSWER QUERIES not rely upon YOU AS AN INTERMEDIARY.

Because of the settings we have on our side as a pro, we received 0 requests for over a month, not because our settings were too strict, but because customers didn't even have the option to match our travel setting. As a Thumbtack customer for over 2 years, and one that has paid thousands of dollars to Thumbtack for their service, this is incredibly disheartening. 

While the support rep I talked to was incredibly kind, she provided me with no good solutions other than editing our settings to include preferences we actually don't do as a business. This work around is unacceptable because it doesn't actually solve the problem. The problem is that customers can't select a travel preference anymore. I should not have to include false preferences as a pro just to accommodate an error on Thumbtacks end. 

I have worked in tech for many years, and when I receive an answer like ""I'll submit this to our development team for review"" I assume the problem isn't being seriously addressed.

In the future, if there is a workflow change on the customers end that effects a pros settings the pro should absolutely be updated so they can make the necessary changes.",More than once

My experience with Alexandria was the most insulting and unprofessional experience I have ever had. First off look at my track record with Thumbtack, I'm a 5 STAR TOP PRO with over 30 hires and 16 plus 5 STAR reviews. 

So I had a client that was calming I didn't finish the job, well we agreed to part ways and he wanted a partial refund. Well this person Mr. Williams is a person that will never be happy. 

So he filed a complaint with the Resolution Center. We went back and forth, well I was getting emails from Alexandria stating that she was suspending my account until she can get conformation that Mr. Williams got his refund!

 Are you kidding me your taking the clients word over your 5 STAR TOP PRO! On top of that I provide documentation from my PayPal account that the refund was being processed. She still wanted to get conformation from Mr. Williams. I have NEVER ben so insulted and disrespected in my life. First off how did she "" ""Alexandrian"" not know that Mr. Williams did not already receive his refund? She also stated in an email that she tries to be ""neutral"" well explain to me how this is  being neutral?? When she obviously took Mr. Williams word over mine? Is that really how this process is supposed to work?

Then late last week Alexandrian seem to realize that I was correct and she stated that she has been in contact with Mr. Williams and ""ASSURED"" him that the refund was being processed due to the PayPal refund documentation I've provided to her per her request. At that point she reinstated my account.

Know had this whole process been handled that way I wouldn't be so very very disappointed in Alexandrian's unprofessionalism's. How she handled this case was so very immature.  Once again I'm so extremely upset that my account was even considered to be suspended, once again look at my track record, that should provide me with a lot of creditability. Which I received none, who's more important to Thumbtack? Pros like me to help pay the bills or a client complaining on an issue that you have to documentation that ever took place.",More than once

In the past I have ALWAYS been refunded for this, but Britany refused to and implied that everyone that has helped me with this same issue in the past wasn't following the policy. So either Britany or all the other Thumbtack customers staff has done wrong, in this case I believe Britany doesn't know the policy. Or perhaps everyone should go over the policy together since different things seems to be told depending on whom I'm talking to. Britany completely ignored that I've been helped with this in the past and her overall attitude felt like she just wanted to end the chat before the issue was solved.

Christian: I checked the customer's account but she has only provided 1 review and that is for Loreta. The review was made last December 12, 2011. Anyway, in order for me to assist you, I will send an email to Alexandra Huff and teach her how to provide you a review.

Christian: I am sorry but no review can be seen on your account and on the customer's account.
Christian: Yes, it is best to inform her so that she can do it again.
Christian: After our chat, I will send her an email and I will update you within 48 hours or once I will hear from her.

I researched this and found that both postings were from the same company. (info1@bobdavies.com, Shannon N and Mari K, both with Vashay). Adam did not believe me and refused the refund. 

The client did respond back, Shannon, and did confirm that it was the same meeting and that I should follow up with Mari. I called back for Adam and he issued the refund on this update. 

It never should have gotten to this. There was enough of a ""proof"" to issue the refund based on my research, my request and the similarity in the request through Thumbtack.

Today when I called and spoke with a specialist they confirmed that pro assist is taking the first 3 quotes. Now that leaves only 2 spots for all the other djs. I should not be penalized for choosing not to participate in pro assist. I was happy the way it was. I'm a good client. Look up my credits. 
Every time you guys make changes it concerns me. I predict pro assist will not work in the Dj category. Please stop tinkering with everything. If it ain't broke don't fix it.

You guys took the best reviews off my page when you changed your policy about the amount of outside reviews. I am not happy that they are no longer there since these are some of my best customer reviews.
 I was telling all my customers (thumbtack or not) to leave feedback. Hind sight is I should have sent them to google but I was supporting you guys. Now you change your policy and deleted some of the best reviews I have had. Then you screen shot them back to me so i cant easily copy and paste them to benefit my business.
You have adversely affected my business. I never get any free leads from customers who used to pick me. I used to get allot of them. Now none. Look up in my history. 
What would make me happy is putting all of my reviews back on here and not allow any outside reviews moving forward. That would be the right thing to do.
When did you change your policy? 
My business has dropped off completely since you did this. I won best of 2015. not best of 2016. I am way off my business model, in all or part for your policy change and one bad review that you'll leave but will take down all of my significantly great reviews.???
 Will you do the right thing? I hope so.

Since square footage was taken out of the request form that is submitted by customers, and I am a house cleaning company that quotes based on square feet, I can no longer use Thumbtack.  So I called earlier in the week and discussed that with one of your team members.

But I still has some credits so I submitted a couple quotes to use them, and somehow I was put on auto replenish, so now I have spent another $212 on credits that I will not use.  I called to have that transaction voided and was told to call back in a couple days after the transaction clears.  

First of all, putting my account on auto replenish when I cannot use Thumbtack any more is clearly not right.  I have never put my account on auto replenish and of course would not now, knowing that I am not going to spend money going forward.

Then, to say ""call back in a couple days"" since there is not way to cancel the transaction until it clears the bank, is wrong as well.  I take credit cards from my client and I know a transaction can be voided before it clears.  So asking me to call back is ridiculous.

I was asked to join the new quoting system back in October and I did, and I provided a lot of feedback and worked for 4 months to get it right, sending over 35 emails to your group to help.  Then, your team decided to take away square feet so I can no longer quote, then your team charged me $212 for more credits I will not use.

I used Thumbtack for over a year and spent $3,000 since January 2016.  I don't think I have been rewarded very well for that.  Terrible.

On too many occasions I have contacted support to provide constructive criticism about the ineffectiveness of ""related"" or ""suggested"" quotes, which are from categories which are SPECIFICALLY deselected in my settings.  So quote requests, thinly veiled as ""related"" to some other category, or considered acceptable despite clearly being from categories I have SPECIFICALLY DE-SELECTED in my settings, because they're supposedly ""suggested"", is a massive, and ongoing waste of my time.  The email and text notifications are a distraction and point of frustration.

(She is ultra-responsile and made it a practice to tell her other customers.)  I checked--with her over my shoulder--and sure enough she was correct.  It was in the fine print.  (I only feel i can tell you now, because she is no longer with you.)  

Without going into how this happened--because we have already gone through several rounds of assurances that you are not set-up this way--I obviously was not interested in doing business with Thumbtack again.  However, when looking for a French tutor, recently, I didn't realize that I had stumbled onto the same company; thus, i wanted out, but could not get anyone to check if I was being  charged.  All I could receive was computer-generated messages followed by assurances that this does not happen at Thumbtack.

A very distance third was that housekeeper I found was at the end of a handful of people who didn't show-up.

*****

Generally, these forms are pointless to fill-out, but I am doing this one last time because I did find a responsible person at a time when I was ill and need one.  So you have your one responsible person to thank, even though she alerted me to the fact that my fee was turning over automatically.  I know longer know the ethics of dealing with companies--and you are not, of course, the only one--who practice such tactics and cut every corners.  You have written to me a handful of times about this matter; none of your customer service was a fraction of the length of this explanation, for which you have asked by computer and, hopefully, a person . . . perhaps, half-a-dozen times after this second incident.

It has been hours since this change, and I still am receiving requests within only 150 mile radius constraint in Thumbtack.

This is EXTREMELY frustrating, as I have talked with several (maybe 8 or 9) Thumbtack agents through 2016 and today.
In 2016 (when I was a Top Pro), a Thumbtack agent told me that I was not alone, and many professionals gave this feedback that the travel radius should be expanded.  The agent told me (in 2016) that Thumbtack, in response to this frequent feedback, planned to change the options, expanding the radius options in January 2017.  It's now March 2017 and the constraint is still there.

I have goals to expand my business, and unfortunately, though I love Thumbtack for what it was to me in 2016, to meet my goals I must now seek clients/prospects outside Thumbtack.  That may mean that I move to Gigsalad or Gigmasters (Gigmasters has a travel radius of 500 miles, and with their Gold membership option, the entire US & Canada).  Or it may simply mean that I more proactively seek clients through my own direct marketing efforts.

 I'm also upset with the stump grinding, the price increase for the stump grinding and the stumps are not ground deep enough, the stumps are not down to ground level! I had fill dirt around the stumps with blocks surrounding the trees, making a garden for flowers. the stumps are level with the fill dirt but not level to the rest of the yard! and the biggest stump that he worked on is full of sharp points. ill have to ether get another grinding CO. to do the job correctly. or ill have to. he stated that the increase in price was due to the size of the stump ( witch he looked at prior to working on them. and he tried to tell me that part of the price increase was due to having to buy new chains for the saw. I know better, you just have to sharpen it not just buy new chains.  

 I'm waiting for the slab to be completed before I bring up the issues I have because I worry that he might not do his best work! once I have the permits ill get on him to finish the job. just a reminder, I paid him in full ( $6000 ) before he even started. my mistake!! if he does not get the slab ready before the building is ready for shipping ill have to wait another 6 to 12 weeks.

Gigsalad does not let anyone ask for a quote without registering with a credit card.  I have booked only one gig, and made lots and lots of quotes.  Today, I got a request, and only minutes later, it was gone.  So, I got over $800 fork gigsalad for Christmas, but only one from Thumbtack.  I quit Thumbtack last time, because i did not get any bookings.  I am pretty sure that many of your customers are just using the ""quote"" to find out what people charge, so they can hire someone locally for less.  The fees for the quotes are very reasonable, so that is not the problem.  Gigsalad charges $20 for gigs that are confirmed.  So, the Credit cost does not amount to that much, but I think that my credit costs will equal what I made on the only gig that I  got from.

The answer I received was vague, which, to me, means that no one at Thumbtack had the answer. The question was, ""What is a life event?"" The reason for the question is that most everything is a life event when one is looking for a photographer. Weddings, baptisms, commitment ceremonies, graduations, birthday parties etc. are all life events. The problem arises when someone uses this ""life event"" category with little or no other information. The solution your Thumbtack consultant and I mutually agreed could be the answer was to quote on a time basis only and leave the quote open ended until the client provides more information. Not the best solution in this competitive business but a workable one. This refers to  A-108070.

I have been spending $100+ on many many quotes and do not get any hires. My profile has been reviewed, upgraded, includes video, I have a bunch of 5 star reviews, etc.
The one thing I learned is that people who view my video and I am not hired indicate that my money is lost. This also applies to people who hire nobody. If they knew that the 5 proposals they received cost the pros like me more than $140 when they just leave, maybe they would at least hire one person.
I think for Thumbtack to work for me a huge improvement would be an indicator that the quotes have been viewed and that a pro was hired or nobody was hired.

So I have a solution to your problem and how you can possibly find out who these people are so you don't keep having to return our money and waste time on the whole refund process. This will help you even out odds a bit as well. 

So I attempted to see what you all ask our potential cliets and I have to say the questions are rather weak. 
A true client seeking out a service will be more forthcoming with information than a fake client and possibly your competitors. 
A big important thing to ask for is a phone numbet! Mandatory! This will not only help you figure out who is scamming you but will also deter your competitors from trying to make you guys look bad. As it stands even pros who are having success with you still have this complaint. You need to collect more data. 
You might say what if they put down the wrong number WELL then that is a person the might send up a red flag that may not really want a quote. It is only fair that they share their information with us as we are sharing it with them. It is a two way street. If you think by making this mandatory you may be out of business because bad press travels much quicker and this seems to be a major complaint amongst pros who are really doing well but feel you are not doing your best to screen and protect them. 

There is a good chance your competitors  are trying to infiltrate your quotes to make you look bad like you are the ones sending us bogus quotes and taking our money. So this is just an extra step to protect not only yourself but ultimately your clients(which are in fact the pros).",Once

I have had some early success with thumbtack but have run into a problem. The problem I found with this system is you don't know how serious the interest of the prospect is. So I have been hesitant to use my credits. As in the past I would offer more quotes. Thumbtack should look into a program where the prospect would have to pay a small fee such as $9.99. After they book it would be refunded back by the provider. That way the prospect is investing in getting a booking. Right now people might just be curious but are not in a position to pay. The pro has no control over what is a serious inquiry or not. I hope the program changes. I am already looking into a alternative to thumbtack because of this issue.

2478849,LiveOps Inbound Support Call,Credits / Pricing / Payments,Explaining credits,Devin Lane,Support 09,Jeremy Visser,2/20/2017 7:40 PM,2/20/2017 9:53 PM,3,"It all depends on what occurs as a result of our conversation.  For my profession, it's too soon to begin charging massage therapists three credits (as opposed to two) because the recession is either NOT over, especially for those in my line of work, or hasn't been over soon enough for massage therapists to start getting ""regulars"" again.  A Regular client is one who comes weekly, or twice a month, or three times a month or every month.  That's what all seasoned professional massage therapists had before the GREAT RECESSION HIT IN 2008.  Since that time, I, for one, have only had ONE, that's right, one (1) regular client and that's only been since last July and that's only because he's rich enough to afford to pay me to massage both him and his wife every week when they are not traveling.  There are reasons for this:  Unfortunately, people are still afraid of spending ""disposable income"" on my services because many if not all people still view massage as a luxury item they don't need or else get for the birthday.  They don't see massage as something they need to stay healthy or that it's good for something other than their skin or back pain.   I get good tips, $10-$15 on average.  I get great reviews.  So I've wondered why clients don't come back.  I am thinking about sending out a form letter asking clients why they don't:  Is it for financial reasons?  My location?  My office?  My skills?  Just to know why they tip me so well and love my work and their pain is gone but they still don't become regulars.  If most of my clients were regulars, it'd make sense to pay you $5 instead of $3.33; however, that's not the case.  So when you charge me 3 credits, that's $5.00 for me to not only risk not getting the job since I'm competing with up to four other massage therapists for the same job, but even if I do get the job and the client doesn't return, the money I paid to finally get hired by anybody still must be subtracted from the income I DID make that month.  IT'S TOO SOON TO START CHARGING US THREE CREDITS TO SEND A QUOTE.    I CAN'T AFFORD TO PAY YOU FOR THE RISK THAT I WON'T BE HIRED.  IT ADDS UP, OK?  Say it took five time paying you before I got a $60 for an hour's worth of massage plus $10 top.  I have to subtact five times $3.33 from $70  I made on that client.  Think of five times $5, that's $25 subtracted from $70.  In effect, you're putting me out of the competition.  And from what I hear, it's putting others out as well.  You had a GREAT business model.  There's an old saying:  ""If it ain't broke, don't fix it.""  Why mess with a good thing?  Aren't you making enough money?  You get paid for the business lead while I'm the one who actually does the physical labor--the hard part.  You've got a good thing going which meant I also had a good thing going.  Now you want to go and change all of that.  Question is:  WHY?",

The desired level of service questions leaves much to be desired. Thumbtack's reasoning according to Aanchal Ramani, who manages the DJ category stated 'we decided to replace the budget question with the ""desired type of service"" question is because our data showed us that our budget answer options were often unrealistic. Because of current limitations in our product, we can't adapt the budget answer options based on the customer's gig specifications - for example, someone could request a DJ for a 6-hour event with a budget of only a few hundred dollars, which set unrealistic expectations and reduced a customer's likelihood of hiring a pro'. When a customer plans an event such as a wedding they have a budget limit for EVERY portion of their event (flowers, photography, food, etc.) whether it's unrealistic or not. So if they already know what their budget is going to be for a DJ before submitting their request then I should know that as well. The real reason in my opinion that the budget question was eliminated for the DJ service is because many of the service pros aren't going to submit a quote on a low budget request with a large amount of hours (i.e. a budget of $300-$400 for a 6 hour event). Therefore Thumbtack doesn't make any money. My guess is that the DJ service category is probably the most requested service on Thumbtack so that's a big money maker for Thumbtack. Why not have the budget question along with the desired level of service & let the DJ service pro determine it if meets their expectations? After all I would be the one taking the chance & doing the work. Not Thumbtack. If Thumbtack truly cares about the seeing me & other service pros succeed then you'll bring the budget question back.",My issue is not resolved

I would like to also give some constructive feedback on Thumbtack's policy to not allow editing of reviews.  I was told multiple times from Thumbtack employees that Thumbtack does not allow editing of reviews in because it has a policy of honesty.  In my case, we were initially pleased with the work done by the Pro, but within 2 days, the caulking became worse than before the Pro came and the Pro wasn't responsive to our requests to fix it even though when he was in our home he said he would be.  Allowing us to update the review would have been more honest because that was the full situation.  It's like in a court of law in the US.  One is swore in to tell ""the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth.""  Not allowing Thumbtack customers to edit reviews, will in some cases like mine, cause ""the whole truth"" to be hidden from other Thumbtack customers.  I grant you that there are likely times when not editing reviews would be the honest thing to do, I just wanted to let you know that, at least in my case, it wasn't and caused me to 2nd guess the reviews on the Thumbtack website.  And 2nd guessing those reviews makes me less likely to trust and hire pros from the site.",

I made a bid for their LOWEST stated paying price. They emailed me and acted offended saying ""that is too much"" for their simple wedding. If it was too much, why did they make a request saying they'd pay that? Having said that, I feel that should be included in your refund policy that if someone is not willing to pay their lowest asking price then obviously they were not making a serious request.

You should also ask questions about THUMBTACK not just the person I talk to.  I was dissatisfied with my Thumbtack service - LONG wait time to talk to a real person and repetitive prompts to use automated impersonal communication approaches.  When an article doesn't address my problem I don't like text and chat alternatives generally.  I want to talk to PEOPLE.
Suggestion: provide an easy email address for a feedback/suggestions/improvements option.  T-tack has come a long way with many great improvements over the last many years.  Keep it up but don't lose your human touch.
Suggestion: For pressure washing category - the deck or patio/porch option in the job profile is NOT helpful.  Provide a category that helps pros know the surface being cleaned - not descriptively like patio or porch or deck but rather something like, wood, concrete, brick.  A pro can't bid on a surface he doesn't know and responding with N/A is off-putting to customers because it indicates an extra step in the process.  As it is now I have to hedge or sidestep the issue or bid blindly.

I have responded to well over 100 RFP's, created a profile that your people tell me is great, a wealth of photos that show my balloon artistry, and provided customer reviews that are sparkling.

with most of the ""Balloon Artistry"" requests that I have answered I have offered to include magic when all the guest's requests for balloon animals and hats have been satisfied if there is time lefty in the assignment.

I am at my wits end with my Thumbtack quest for business.  I have spent nearly 40 years and my company has produced close to 20,000 events.  My personal closing ratio was in the high 70% because we enjoyed a stellar reputation and great repeat business.

I am a Certified Event Professional, I have been employed to speak at event conventions for more that 20 years, I have written 2 books one on how to create a memorable special event which was used as a text book at GWU and the second one on sales.  I have penned more than 100 articles, some published internationally on special events, sales and business.

All of that and 1 sale in more than 100 try's with Thumbtack...  What do you see as the problem?  

Thanks for asking and I look forward to your solution

I opted for the text message option.  It took 2 HOURS to receive a text back.  I will never do that option again.  I decided to try again today.

Day 2 ..after bring on hold for over 40 MINUTES I was ready to hang up, when finally someone answered.  The rep was extremely professional, pleasant, and empathetic.  I had a very nice and extended conversation on the pros and cons of Thumbtack.

My advice is drop the text message customer service.  Its impersonal and slow to respond.  Also, the ""we have been extremely busy"" and ""high call volume"" excuse doesn't fly with me.  Hire more people. Its old and tired and no one cares.

Next, come up with a system of vetting your customers more thoroughly. Thumbtack is a haven for money launderers trying to run credit card scams.  I don't have the time to waste on these vermin.  

Kudos to the rep that I finally got through to.  She is a keeper.  She should be rewarded somehow for her professionalism.  I WAS NOT in a good mood by the time I finally got through.

I hope you take my criticism constructively and seriously.

One of the reasons why I was so upset was not just the amount that thumbtack raised the coast of sending a quote. But I referred a buddy of mine Chris Hill to thumbtack. I didn't do it by your reference program . I just told him how happy I have been in the past with thumbtack and showed him the app and gave him a brief explanation of how to use thumbtack. And it seems as if  that Turned and bit me in the butt.  He was quoting all the same jobs as I  received yet he was was able to send all of his quotes for free because he was a brand new pro. And the price for me to bid on jobs was raised. Therefore I sincerely regret promoting thumbtack one of my buddies because it doesn't benefit me it now cost me more money to bid on the same job that he was biding on for free yesterday. I'm sorry but that does not make me want to promote thumbtack to anybody else. There are no benefits in it for me only for you.

Since I've lost my status as a ""top pro"", I've noticed a significant increase in hold time whenever I call the customer service number. Additionally, the prompts constantly push the caller to visit online support or text questions and wait for a reply. I find this extremely agitating, as we already know that we can visit your website, but the reason for calling is to speak with a person! 

For me, Thumbtack has stood out simply due to its wonderful customer support and service. However, not having ""top pro"" status is highly reflected in my customer service experience.

When my call is finally answered, I am satisfied with the level of service and my issues are addressed. Suggesting that I visit your website for answers is insulting. It is intuitive that visiting a website is the 1st stop in seeking answers to questions. It just the time we live in. I call because it is my preference to ""speak"" with someone and experience the human side of Thumbtack. 

Thank you,

In this case, the professional eventually made good on it, but if he hadn't I would've been stuck. 
I've spent thousands of $$ on work provided through Thumbtack professionals and going forward, I'm a bit leery as to whether it's worth it or not. I have roofing people fixing our rental property today, and I wasn't comfortable using Thumbtack so I hired a local company on my own instead. Maybe over time I'll feel different, but for now I'm not sure I can take the chance with Thumbtack anymore.",

Had I followed my initial feeling about the lead it never would have been purchased in the first place due to the (2) major red flags that I noticed (and still did not let prevent me from going ahead with the purchase). The main reason why I went ahead and bought the lead anyway is because years ago I had to come to a bride and groom's rescue years on a wedding that their initial photographer backed out on them, so that is why I took a chance on the lead in spite of the obvious red flags that were present (no phone number), (request for ""engagement photos"", normally done months or several weeks before the wedding date). As I am sure upper-level management there at Thumbtack as well as management at other websites know by now, there are people out there on the internet who are filling out request forms with absolutely zero intention of hiring any vendors. Companies can only do so much to weed out and screen these type of individuals because they go from site to site filling out request forms. Me personally, I had been away and inactive from Thumback for a very very long time and I recently came back and logged into the site to look around, so I decided to give the site a chance and see how things go in the weeks ahead as I look at some of your many leads and clients who are in need of my professional services.

I don't think she understood the full issue I was having with the Pro Assist situation but, neither did the first two people I chatted with via the on-line help. 

I think you should have certain areas within the Help Area to chat with someone directly in one of the teams (i.e Pro Assist Team) that deals with the immediate issue.  it was obvious that Lora was either new to her position or was totally confused on what I was trying to relay to her.  Too much to go into there.  And, Vincent really was no help at all.

I'm the Ballroom-Latin-Country dance business. Private lessons involve 1 person with their instructor serving as their partner, or 2 people partnership with 1 instructor to help them. If it's 2 people who are not partners, they need separate private lessons or an existing Group Class. If it's 3 or more people, industry standards define that as a ""Group Class"", even if it's designed just for their party. It seems that they are answering questions that lead them to have a different idea of how most partnership dancing businesses operate. Let me know if I can further advise or help.",Once

My company asked me if the most recent $3.33 charge from Thumbtack was legit; I said it was. Ultimately, the charge was reimbursed, because it wasn't reviewed within the 48-hour window. I have two credits. As soon as I use those, I will close my account.

On your webmite I couldn't find phone number for customer service. I had to look on google, and that took a few wrong 800 #s.  Again asking the vendors on their original questioare which we receive; a required question:  Do you offer a sliding scale and 1/2 hour rates?  That way if we are on a limited budget we can find someone affordable and not have to lose a lot of time prescreening based on our income.   By the way there seems to a very qualified martial arts trainer/martial artist named Max, who also speaks Russian too and said he would help me with a sliding scale.  He really seems nice.  Thanks so much.  Thanks for offering me the job working with you.  Salt Lake city would be a great move someday.

On one hand, I get it. But, it can go a little far. Ex, I inquired about a recent quote where I forgot to follow-up for a few days, and ask simply if it looked like the customer started communicating with intention to hire one of the other quoting pros before I sent my follow-up, ie, did I miss out? No specific info queried, no pro name, anything about them; simply were there messages sent whereby it looked like the client was talking to a pro to hire them before I even messaged. Couldn't give me that info. It seems giving non-specific info would not be detrimental to anyone. Not sure why stuff like that isn't allowed.",

I think that that is way too high. I told Alyssa that I would now think twice about sending out a quote through Thumbtack. I was paying $3.33 a quote before and it is now up to $5 a pop. 
I was only using Thumbtack and telling others to use them as pros and students, but now I don't think so.

Only issue is I paid  $15.99 for 7 credits for 1 solar lead that turned out to be a fraudulent post from another Solar competitor. That's just a ripoff. I would have never paid that much if I knew it was a bogus lead. I've done a bunch of responses and got maybe 3 responses and nothing positive. There's no way someone is going to post for solar and only get 5 responses and they don't request a proposal.  Makes zero sense. I'm really feeling like thumbtack is a scam and posting fake posts so we buy more credits.  Hundreds of dollars and not 1 sale.  That's insane.,Once

However, I am very upset at the outcome...which she had nothing to do with. On December 6th,  I received an email from Thumbtack showing my stats in comparison to the requirements for Top Pro status. It clearly showed that I met the requirements. I placed a follow-up call to Thumbtack to make sure and was told that I indeed met all of the requirements. As a result, I stopped bugging my clients for reviews. I had been contacting them nonstop for reviews to ensure that I met the requirements. When I found that I had, I stopped pursuing reviews as it was the middle of a busy holiday season and I didn't want to bug them anymore! 
I didn't receive a top pro badge because after some digging, Kayla found out that I had a 4.79 rating and not the 4.8 that the email stated I had. I am very upset over this. When I started on Thumbtack, a friend of mine was awarded a top pro badge and I determined right then that I would achieve the same. I worked diligently all year to do so. This is a major disappointment. Especially since I called and spoke to a representative to ensure that the the stats were correct. 
I received 50 credits today as a consolation prize of sorts but I am not satisfied. I'd like the badge that I worked so hard for this year.
I am looking forward to the resolution I seek in this matter.
Thank you.

But I must reiterate my dissatisfaction with the obvious shift to eliminating/hiding obvious customer service phone number for a pro's one to one contact with a CSR.  This was one of the things I thought was outstanding about Thumbtack previously,  excellent and available reps to give feedback and get help with issues encountered on the site. 

 A NUMBER of issues I have brought up have been related to functionality of your site, including glitches that often appear to be hitches in functionality of the software or programming that seemed to have  'slipped through the cracks'.  Overall you have a very good service, which seems to be successful. AND this is obviously in part to the large number of employees you have. 

HOWEVER,  while boasting about the $270 plus million dollars raised through your investors,  I believe that your decision to gut your readily available human customer service rep contact phone (or more accurately bury it as deeply in the site as possible) was a poor choice, and is a pretty obvious indicator that you DO NOT want your PROs to contact you.    

In short, I am annoyed by your instead implementing  a voluminous bank of FAQ's  trying to cover every possible scenario and circumstance Pros may encounter.  IT's bad enough that you've virtually eliminated obvious customer service call in number, but you have furthermore implemented pull down menus with stat categories  WITHOUT an 'OTHER' category OR  providing  an obvious way to generate a custom email for assistance. 

YOU CAN NOT cover every single instance of problems or issues with FAQ's!!  Or even texts!..This is almost ridiculous, making your pros spend enormous amounts of time combing through the menus, trying to dig for answers,  when, as in this particular case of call in, speaking directly with a live, human CSR was absolutely necessary.   Please do not take offense at my comments.  I am just giving you honest feedback in the interests of improving your service and your perception with both your pros who are your lifeblood and customers.",

Here's a few initial suggestions: For markets and categories that are very competitive, such as Phoenix is, the 5 quote limit does not seem to be enough. I've responded in under a minute in at least 2 bids, and it had already reached the 5 quote limit. Please consider allowing up to ten in these particular saturated markets/categories. 

The review system is not working well. I know of at least 2 reviews from external and internal people that have not shown up. And I personally left a review for a Thumbtack Pro that was never posted. As well as him leaving one for me, twice without it showing up. It's frustrating when you are able to get a party to take time to do a review, only for it to be lost. We mostly only get one shot at doing this. 

Lastly, it seems that some requests are promptly read, but they don't follow through with any of the five quotes. There should be a way to refund credits in this situation when the requester is flaky. I don't know what the vetting process is and if they actually pay credits when asking for a quote, or if it's free to the end user.

Thanks for your time! John Wroble",Once

Thumbtack, however, has now joined our list of vendors to be replaced. I have said it before, and been told we are working on a solution, but can't share it just yet, since September. 5 months is plenty of time to at least update us on why the cost to quote brides in the upper categories is costing nearly $30,a quote, for a bride to merely open it and never touch it again. 3 quotes equals my MONTHLY expense for a full time listing with Wedding Wire. But to be further told that now, the top pro designation is for those quoting 100+ times in the last 12 months, hired a minimum of 5 timez, and have 5 reviews that are verified, that took the cake. Assuming someone like myself bids in jobs in the budget of their price range, I would be forced to spend $2,500 a year, to maybe book 5 brides, and hope you verify all of them and they all leave reviews. That's more than I spend advertising with Wedding Wire, Purple Unions, and Wedding.com COMBINED. It's equal to what I spend with theKnot, and all those others listed just now. Just to be considered for Top Pro? 

I have begun turning vendors away from thumbtack, and advising my cohorts to join other quote services like wedding.com and bridal quotes.com, as they are still taking care of their customers. I hope Thumbtack gets it together, as the lunacy of asking us to continue 
to spend so much for nearly nothing in return is going to cost you many, many vendors in your photography category. 19 credits for a wedding is obsurd when a bride opens the quote and never even looks at your profile, never visits your website, never says at single word to you.",My issue is not resolved

Yoradyl was very helpful, responsive and caring about my issue and getting it resolved. Yoradyl made sure to follow-up with me first thing this morning (contact started yesterday), after promising to do so. Yoradyl's excellence in customer service, as well as a comprehensive team of professionals, is the reason most businesses thrive. Customers appreciate knowing and feeling valued by their service providers and product manufacturers. It's the same level of professionalism my clients expect from me. Bravo!

Not due to part of my support agent Ian but due in whole part of the professional we hired. He was very difficult to deal with. I feel the type of discussion style forum was useful but it all depends on the two parties and their willingness to have a dialogue. In my case the professional was unwilling to respond, untruthful and combative. Which didn't make the support experience agreeable. I would make 2 suggestions. 1. I would set time restrictions on response times. Support agent requested the professional to respond several times and professional disregarded request which prolong the situation and only added to already unpleasant situation. 2. I would have support agent to call at least one time in the beginning to hear the client?s grievance. Having an online forum is fine but with no human interaction at least once gave me feeling of disconnection.

By the end of the conversation I had learned how to do that project on Thumbtack as well as a few other features the very kind, young gentleman taught me. He was patient with me, walked me through the steps several times and listened to what happened to one of your pro hires and he was very compassionate and apologized from the company about my updated review. He put me on hold several times to make sure he was giving me the correct information and to make sure I didn't want to take the complaint further through your company. But what I want to talk abut most importantly is the mannerism of your employee named Djadon. He was the most pleasant, kind, young man. We talked about life stories that both of us related to as people. If that kid-o ever visits Alaska he would be welcome in my home. As a person and a customer of Thumbtack, I am telling you this is the kind of person you want to hire and keep him employed forever. It is very important to make a phone call and get someone knowledgeable but when you get his personality added to the mix, it makes for a very pleasant day? I will never forget this phone call, EVER!!!!!!!!!!

I just wish thou, you would put me online as one of your Top Ten Water Damage Restoration Contractor that i see pop up every time I check on my website and I see thumbtack.com top Ten Water Damage Restoration Contractors for Snohomish County. .I see only one company i heard of. I give nothing but praises for Thumbtack.com and how thumbtack .com increased by business about 50% last year with the extra volume of work I got from Thumbtack.com. I have established great property management company contacts as well as other clients here in the Seattle Area.
Thumbtack,com is a very good company to work with and the leads has been great as well. Prices are awesome compared to Home Advisor.com They are CROOKS!!!! I am not joking. They charge for what they call Direct Lead. They finally had enough of that company sending me leads and once 7 other contractors were sent to the same property. By the time I got there the homeowner was very mad. It is all about money with them. I had to almost sue them to get my money back that they stole. They charged me once $60.00 for a person that had a branch rubbing against her window and wanted to know what it took to remove it. I called them very mad being the stupid price they just came up with to charge me. I called them and that was the icing on the cake as you would say. I told them that why did they send that to me when I don't do landscaping. Then with my bad back and I told them up front and it is in writing that i do not go into crawlspaces then what happens, yep you got it. They sent three in a roll. They have their heads all on backwards.The left hand does not know what the right hand is doing. That is why their former company failed Service Magic. They were chasing me that long to sign up with them.
So you see why i am so happy Thumbtack.com is now going.strong up here.
Thumbtack.com is a great company and I am so proud to be part of this team of contractors. 
Thank you again once more for all your help in helping me grow my company again. I will never let your company down and if you have any questions about contracting here in the Seattle Area or any questions regarding the Contractor License Requirements, please feel free to call me anytime.

The quote system is effective and leads to further discussions with the customer.  This is much better a process than the alternate rush to phone back system 

ThumbTack is always on in my office.  The other services I use are always off.  If someone wants to man the phone to instantly call back then they are turned on.

You offer a preferred way to do business.  The refunds are applied for all bidders for a withdrawn service request.  This is what is called 'fair'.  Alternately, I have people requesting HVAC install (large charge) then I call and they only want a toilet install, call for refund etc etc.

I recommended you service to other franchises that use your service -- do I get a commission?",

I just wish when a customer changes their mind and cancel the service call after the pro bids on it that Thumbtack would also refund the quote points. 

Us pros spend our time and money to quote and when they change their mind after seeing the cost to get the repairs, its no fault of the bidder ( pro)

Please review my account profile and credit me back all the quotes that the customer changed their minds.

Thank You

Nice enough, but gave me the incorrect information I confirmed with his acknowledgement was incorrect.  Happened earlier today with another rep.  Support is in no way supportive when they're just guessing at answers.  And apparently there's no accountability when they provide random information off the top of their head.  But it has happened numerous times.  I know for a certainty, because in each instance I provide the specific examples or circumstances that negate it.  Not good.  Fortunately Eric picked up my chat this afternoon after Caesar dropped off thinking I wasn't on the line or something, even though I was just waiting for him to get to my question.  He apparently got lost in the chat and thought he was waiting for me but I had already posed my questions at the outset.  Eric provided good information, thorough details and fully answered my questions.  All the reps should be following this standard.  I'm right on the fence in my opinion as to whether reps can be relied upon for guidance, or if they're just strangers taking questions and winging it...",Once

She helped me with my issue and then heard my complaint about a problem that we've had for quite a while with thumbtack. You all
added some so called feature allowing clients to put a limit on how much they're going to pay us! So of course one right after another clicks on the button that says less than $100!    Since our overhead is very high no one can work for less than $100 an hour. So it makes your service useless to us. We have to pay a monthly fee and then we get requests. For jobs were going to lose money on! if we do things right and pay for insurance, taxes etc. or overhead is three or $400 a month.  We usually are lucky to get four Saturdays a month and we have to work a few jobs to pay our overhead. So you're making it impossible for us to make a profit. Clients  might want us to drive two hours each way to work for an hour or even three or four hours, paint 40-100  kids and still only pay less than $100!!!!  I am putting in this feedback forms explaining in detail begging for some response and explanation and not one word from you. I am getting ready to leave Thumbtack and the Face Painter painting business after 27 years  due to that one question and allows people to limit what they pay us. I'm heartbroken because Thumbtack is so awesome except for that One absolutely devastating thing? Less than $100!! I can think of no good reason to have that question. It makes people think we are worth $25 or less hour. Tiny  Face Painter cakes and $17 and don't last very long. Our supplies are so ridiculously expensive if we get the FDA approved paint all of our supplies are expensive? clearly Thumbtack doesn't care about that",Once

On the software itself: I'd definitely like to see more pricing options.  Marketing agencies are $150/hr+, our website pricing starts at $7500.  As far as marketing services, getting a better idea of what the client is looking for would be awesome.  I keep getting people who want SEO for $200 even though I've specifically said our price point is $1000+ (and it's actually $3500+/mo).  Options for more serious Pros would be welcome as well.  I was wading through all these smaller cases and didn't get a chance to bid on one for $5-10k/mo social media marketing, PERFECT for us.  Some kind of separation for the work-from-home $20/hr guys and us would be extremely welcome, and worth more money for that lead.  Is the company that wants to spend 5-10k getting a good experience getting a quote from a non-agency?  Something to consider on your end.",Once

I really hope Thumbtack will figure out a fairer way to charge their professionals. I have to give you guys 200 dollars to make 500 dollars and it's really hard to live each week off of 300 dollars. When 4/5 quotes have already been given why not give away that last quote for free or for only 2 credits??? Why is it still 8 bucks to be the fifth person??? If no one has quoted a customer in 10 hours, give it away for free... you guys use to do that... just like you use to have a phone number readily available... not everyone considers a ""slow automated robot"" or an ""email response 45 minutes later"" as a good way of receiving customer service. I can see why being the first quote costs 11 credits (or dollars since all credits cost are more than about $1.3)... but the second quote should cost 8 bucks the third quote should cost 5 bucks the fourth quote should cost 3 bucks and the last quote free or 1 buck. You guys are profiting I'm sure - please help us profit!!! At the end of the day, half of the users seeking professionals on your app are just window shopping... you have to take that into account when pricing the credits to professionals... or you won't have loyal professionals...these window shoppers are just checking prices before they go with someone, not on thumbtack... which is costing us the professionals money (and hurting our faith in your platform). When I send out 16 quotes for over $160 and 11 out of the 16 people I quote don't even visit my website or hire another professional on thumbtack...that's a costly month for me... when 11 out of 16 just viewed my quote and nothing else...didn't call, didn't email, DIDN'T even hire another guy off thumbtack... I'd be fine if it was going to someone else on thumbtack...that means they won fair and square... but when it just says ""viewed quote"" and we lose all the money and you make all the money... it makes it feel like gambling and it makes me feel like you guys are the casino, ""the house,"" that never loses....if a customer doesn't even visit a website or ask a follow up question... you make all the money and we're losing everything....that's fine but please price us accordingly...  cut us some slack!!! the price of credits in comparison to the number of times hired (and I'm a top pro) is infuriating and way too costly for a professional to consider thumbtack as a smart advertising solution for their small company. The least you can do is refund 50 credits from time to time... just to counter the imbalance of the business market, which is impossible to predict.",Once

Then I thought of it as a 'ring' and said could I put a ring around it then apologized for the Beyonce quote (Grammy's last night) and the agent said , oh, that's ok.

I had went into great detail about an issue I have with my last review.  After sifting through what I felt was some initial doubt, Markay had made an awesome suggestion that I reply, gave me some credits to work with, and advised that I keep them posted.  She is an amazing focused solution orientated professional.  I called desperately seeking advice, and found a calm supportive team.  I am extremely grateful for her positive sentiment.
Unfortunately, I found no success, and called again, to continue seeking alternative solutions.  I spoke with Cliff.  He emailed the client on my behalf to maybe consider an alternative choice of title.  I ranted and raved, and he listened very patiently.  
I am very impressed with the level of patience and fairness the team exhibits.  I am very desperate to be able to maintain my account with Thumbtack, and have been shown nothing  but genuine positive feedback.  All I can say is Thank you.  I went from feeling helpless to confident.  Thank you Markay. Thank you Cliff.",My issue is not resolved

I had done some work for a person a few weeks ago. Now this same person is calling me directly and indicating that if I don't give her a discount on additional work she wants done, then she'll give me a Bad Review on Thumbtack, for the first time I went their. She goes on to tell me that I surely don't want this to happen either, because it wouldn't be good for future business. I take a LOT of PRIDE in what I do and I am VERY CUSTOMER ORIENTED, you can see the proof in my reviews. But I have NEVER ran across anything like this in all the years I've been doing electrical. By the way, the additional work is something she just discovered needed to be done. This lady is making it very difficult and I am SURE she has done something similar like this to other professionals too. When I did go to her home to handle her work, prior to starting the work she explained to me that she had received other quotes that are much lower than mine. I explained that I couldn't drop my price and I proceeded to ask her why she wasn't going with those other quotes. She said she'd rather use me. That answer didn't make any sense to me. I should have declined doing her work. But I was already at her home with my tools too. I hope she doesn't go through with this, but if she does, I will be reaching-out to you guys again. I don't want any BAD REVIEWS on my Profile. I've worked to hard to keep a clean slate.

I have asked repeatedly not to be put in Auto-repay. How am I supposed to control my spending if you keep quoting on my behalf and continually charge my card for more credits ?  And the most frustrating part is that I only discover this by chance and I have called in and spoke on this matter 3 times, this being my 4th time to bring this matter to your attention.   I'll explain again : I am a small one man operation. If you continuously send out quotes and charge me for all the warm contacts, 2 things will happen that I am trying to avoid : 1) spending will be out of my control and 2) I'll never be able to respond properly to those warm contacts.  You'll just be raping me and I will not benefit. I am trying to work the warm contacts and turn them into a paying job so I benefit from my partnership with Thumbtack",My issue is not resolved

People are shopping TT for small jobs and low price. They also do a very poor job describing their project. It can be an expansive gamble and the stats show the house always wins.

I've done well with Thumbtack and receive a good portion of my business from it - but seeing this type of Clientele bothers me that I can't ""compete"" with non-professionals that so undercut a real professional by reducing the value they provide to only the budget offers are realistic - value, experience, insurance, legality - none of this means anything to many of TTs customers.",Once

There were some communications that were crossed and my customer had left a review stating disappointment with my delay in beginning the project even though a scheduled start date had never been discussed.  Never the less I had been called out of town a week before the review was placed to tend to family matters.  I contacted all my current customers and advised them of the need to handle some family matters.  
When I contacted Thumbtack to express my concern with the review they handled it. They looked at my other reviews and could see that there customers have had nothing but positive comments on how I conduct my business. They reached out to the customer that placed the bad review on my business and found out what happen. Come to find out my potential  customer ended up editing her review and all ended up well. This is how I feel customer service should be.  I couldn't be happier with the service Thumbtack provides and the personal service in helping grow my business.

I called due to suspect scam request and he verified that yes, indeed I got another scammer. I'm not often one to complain much but my goodness the scam requests outweigh the real jobs by at least 70% for us. Disappointing as we are a very legit business looking for business like anyone else. 
Since joining Thumbtack  back in Sept, Oct 2016 we have gotten 2 legit jobs and the rest are scam requests.

That has nothing to do w Devin! He was very kind, he always paused to listen and he thanked me for letting you all know about this particular scammer...but I will say I had to wait about 18 minutes for an agent to pick up my call.  That's too long but...thank goodness for speakerphone so I could be busy while on hold.

I hope this was a little bit helpful.  You have excellent representatives...I worked in CS for many years at Nordstrom so I do recognize excellent service when I receive it or when I do not.

You answer in English and your people are kind, understanding, and always helpful. My problem of the day was that my desktop computer had the Thumbtack password and my phone was just changed and lost the app and password.  I needed a reset of the password after trying for almost two days to get the link sent through your automation, but it did not send.  Your rep made a temporary password, which I used to log in, and add Thumbtack again to my phone.  Problem solved.  The question I had then, and I will share now, is that Thumbtack sometimes acts like you are not on the vendor's side.  Long ago you proposed buying credits in blocks instead of just what was needed.  We said, ""no how do we know you will ever have a worthwhile customer to bid on?"" and the policy was dropped.   Today there is a similar situation at Thumbtack.  When I write a response to a customer it is permanent, like an accounting program.  This is not fair to someone who has spent many, many dollars with you over many years.  In order to help your vendors make money, and help you make money I propose this simple thing.   Allow one revision to my response to a comment.   I am not asking to remove, change the placement order, or to in any way modify the customer's comment.   I ask that you allow me to put my business in the best light, and put Thumbtack in the best light by allowing one revision to my comment on a customer comment.    The shortest software writing path to this is to simply allow your representatives to erase or reset my comment, so I can place a permanent one.   Thank you for your assistance and your service.   Now, go get us some more real customers who would like to pay over $300 for a multi camera video !   Best regards, Timothy Greenwood, Magnolia Street Productions.
